# hvv

Navigate the seedy underworld of Hamburg in a truly dystopian way!

## What is this?

This is a command-line application for interfacing with the [routing
service of Hamburger Verkehrsverbund][hvv-web]. It tends to be less
clunky and frustrating than the official website when you are in a rush.

[hvv-web]: https://geofox.hvv.de

## Perks

- **Fast:** optimized for speed and perceived responsiveness!
- **Friendly:** unspecified command-line arguments trigger an interactive mode!
- **Flexible:** written in (mostly) readable and sane Perl!

## Installation

`hvv` depends on `Mojolicious`, an external Perl module. It is likely
available in your distro's repository.

Other than that, just drop `hvv` in your path and you are good to go!
